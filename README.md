# cltdevs meetup manifesto

## Mission statement
We are committed to the Charlotte tech community's growth and sustainability by fostering relationships between individuals and organizations, cultivating individual talents and organizations, and discover and build the missing elements of a thriving tech community.

## Who we are
Our membership is primarily made up of people whose roles are involved in the tech industry and our partnerships include those whose livelihoods and businesses depend on it. Anyone involved directly or indirectly with tech of any kind or those who care about the tech community are invited to join our ranks.

## How we accomplish our mission
We believe that the talent we have in our city is a great asset and it should be carefully tended and grown. To accomplish this, we build bridges, we encourage networking and interaction, and we encourage and facilitate teaching, mentoring, and building. All the while, we strive for a diverse and egalitarian community and welcome anyone who desires to work towards this goal into our ranks.

## How we're different than other meetups / focus groups
We don't seek to differentiate ourselves. In fact, we desire to ally with other meetups and groups. Where we desire learning and teaching to happen, many other groups already serve in this role in many niches. We will seek to partner and help these groups while learning from them and building new opportunities where none exist. We seek to smooth the pipeline from the time a student first desires to pursue a technical career to the time they are first hired, help their skills grow throughout their career, and seek to encourage them to give back to those coming after in the form of mentorship, leadership, and employment.

We encourage everything to be ongoing, encouraging relationships wherever they may be found.

## Our Focuses

### Apprenticeship
We believe that the training and mentoring of new and junior tech talent is currently lacking and is the responsibility of the community at large. We seek to bring the community together to cultivate the talents of these rising new assets to the community. We seek to establish organizations to help bring these people together to learn as well as network with each other and the rest of the community at large

### Mentoring
We believe that it is important for the community to help bring those who are newer to the community into the community. To do this, we seek to gather those who have a strong desire to do this and, for those who are unsure of how to accomplish this themselves, build a framework and find a place for them to do so.

### Training
We believe that constant training is imperative to ALL those in the tech community. Technology is moving incredibly quickly and it is important that we can, as a community, continue to share knowledge and build our collective skills up.

### Leadership
We believe that leadership is rare and we seek to cultivate both by seeking out those who are already good leaders to learn from, but also by giving those among us who accept this calling a path to practice their leadership skills so that this community can serve the community into perpetuity.

## Our Core Principles

### Egalitarianism
As one of the primary principles in our country's founding, we also believe that equal opportunity is important to this community as well.

### Diversity
Diversity isn't just a 'right' thing, it's smart biologically, politically, and financially - it's just smart business. As such, we also believe diversity is important to building a strong organization that will last.

### Community
We believe that the foundation to fostering relationships between people is a sense of belonging and understanding that we have something in common. For this reason, we seek to always remember that we have much in common with one another and are better together than apart.

## Our Activities

### How we handle sponsorship money
We are stronger together. We have the potential to pool resources and do things that individual groups could not coordinate or afford on their own. We can pool the talents of many people across the tech industry as well to accomplish our goals. By working together, we can increase the amount of diversity in our ideas and goals as well so that we are able to serve Charlotte's tech community in the best manner possible.
